		  We at "You Can" strongly believe that with the right guidance and perfect determination, any student willing to learn programming can become a master of coding. All team members at Coding Blocks are aces of their respective field and the share the highest level of commitment towards quality teaching and student success and satisfaction. The present structure of computer education in colleges and universities is not aligned to the needs of the IT Industry. Students have no place to go and bridge this huge gap. It was this realization that prompted me to address this very real need of the student community. Coding Blocks was started as a learning centre where we teach fundamentals of programming to college students. The courses here are designed to help students with their curriculum and give them a real feel of the IT industry. In the last three years, we have helped more than 7200 students achieve their goal and made them the darling of the industry. At Coding Blocks, all our instructors are themselves great coders and highly employable in the Industry. They decided to join Coding Blocks instead of lucrative jobs in the industry because they are passionate about teaching and strongly believe in the company's vision.
