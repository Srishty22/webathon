		  <h1>Why 'YOU CAN' ?</h1>
		  <p>
		  	"You Can" is founded in 2020 with a mission to create skilled software engineers for our country and the world. We aim to bridge the gap between the quality of skills demanded by industry and the quality of skills imparted by conventional institutes.</p>

<h3>LOGIC BUILDING</h3>
<p>Coding in its most essential form is nothing but problem solving. It deals with figuring out logical solutions and implementing them optimally. The process of learning to code, transforms a person into an analytical thinker with strong mathematical and logical skills.</p>

<h3>CAREER TRANSFORMATION</h3>
<p>Having been a standalone field for a long time, the software industry has now come neck to neck with most of the other industries by close coordination and easy integration. From the smallest light bulb to the most massive aircrafts, every industry is now implementing the use of computer programming for the convenience of the end user. A good command over coding can thus open a wide variety of employment opportunities.</p>
<hr><br>



<h3>GLOBAL IMPACT</h3>
<p>Computer programming these days is also being used to address some of the biggest issues that humankind is facing with like climate change, healthcare, education and many more. More than being a developer or a designer, knowledge of coding can also help you become the harbinger of the change that you want to see.</p>
